Affirmative. The production-critical backend tasks are complete. Proceed with Task 4: Enhance the Dashboard UI/UX.

The goal is to transform the dashboard from a simple data overview into a more insightful and visually engaging experience for the customer.

4.1. Redesign the Main Statistic Cards
File: client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx

Action: Update the four main statistic cards (Total Items, Total Value, Insurance, Plan Usage) with a more modern design.

Logic:

Each card should prominently feature a relevant icon from the lucide-react library.

Display the main value in a large, bold font.

Include a descriptive label below the value.

Use the Progress component for Insurance and Plan Usage cards to visually show the percentage used against the total limit. For example, the insurance card should show both the total value of items and the user's total coverage limit.

4.2. Add a "Value by Category" Chart
Action: Create a new reusable component at client/src/components/category-chart.tsx.

Library: Use the recharts library, which is already a project dependency.

Logic:

The component will accept the user's items array as a prop.

It must process this array to calculate the sum of estimatedValue for each item category.

It should render a PieChart from recharts to visualize this data.

The chart should include a Tooltip that displays the category name and its total value on hover.

Integration: Import and add this new component to the dashboard.tsx page, below the main statistic cards.

4.3. Add a "Recent Activity" Timeline
Action: Create another new component at client/src/components/activity-timeline.tsx.

Logic:

The component will accept the user's movements array as a prop.

It should sort the movements by scheduledDate in descending order and take the most recent 3-5 entries.

It should render a simple vertical timeline. Each timeline entry must display an icon (Package for pickup, Truck for delivery), the movement type, and the formatted date.

Integration: Import and add this component to the dashboard.tsx page.

4.4. Verification
Goal: Confirm that the new dashboard UI is implemented and functional. It should display the redesigned, more informative statistic cards, a working pie chart for value distribution, and a timeline of recent movements, all populated with live data.
