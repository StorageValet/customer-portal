So i think there might have been just a little bit of confusion as to why we would want bulk selection and that would be to schedule pickup or delivery of multiple items at once in one fell swoop. To ensure that somebody could add, let's say, 4 different items of different sizes for pickup, and then that will allow us on the operation side to know how big of a truck we need to make sure that we can fit everything with potentially other pickups on the same route etc. The customer is not going to be marking things as "at home" or "in storage". The designation of "at home" or "in storage" is going to be happening ideally automatically based on the status changing of that container which is tied to that QR code which is the identifier. When it gets picked up or put in one place vs another, on the operations end, we would then designate that that container is in storage or is at the customer's home. For our own internal purposes, we may want to classify where exactly in storage each container is because we'll be working to optimize every square and cubic foot of our facilities in the smartest way possible. So we need to rethink how that bulk selection works. It's just critical that the customer can add multiple items for pickup and/or delivery (meaning return delivery) and based on the dimensions, the weight, etc. and what the current pick-up/delivery schedule looks like, the calendar options that they'll be shown will be dynamically changing based on what they've added to their car for pick-up/delivery.
There seems to be some confusion about the need for bulk selection—it’s essential for scheduling the pickup or delivery of multiple items at once. This allows customers to request pickup of several items of varying sizes in a single order, enabling operations to determine the appropriate truck size and optimize route planning for multiple pickups. Customers won’t manually mark items as "at home" or "in storage;" instead, these statuses will update automatically based on the container’s QR code and its movement. Operationally, we’ll track where each container is—both whether it’s at home or in storage, and its exact location within storage—to maximize space efficiency. We need to rethink bulk selection to ensure customers can easily schedule pickup or delivery (including returns) for multiple items at once. The scheduling calendar should dynamically update based on the number, size, and weight of items selected, as well as current availability.
