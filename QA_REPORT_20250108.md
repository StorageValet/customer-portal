  "ingest": {"ok": true, "recent": 4}
}
```

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Registration Flow | ‚úÖ | Working via /api/ingest endpoints |
| Authentication | ‚úÖ | Login/Signup/Sessions working |
| Item Management | ‚úÖ | Creation working (without value field) |
| Movement Scheduling | ‚úÖ | Validation working correctly |
| Session Management | ‚úÖ | Fixed middleware order issue |
| TypeScript | ‚úÖ | No compilation errors |
| UI Loading | ‚úÖ | React app serves correctly |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify "Estimated Value" field exists in Airtable
   - Test photo upload functionality with real images
   - Run full E2E test with real form submission

2. **Before Production**:
   - Set `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for HMAC security
   - Test with production Stripe keys
   - Verify email sending with SendGrid
   - Load test the registration endpoints

3. **Code Quality**:
   - All TypeScript checks passing
   - Error handling in place
   - Proper validation on all endpoints
