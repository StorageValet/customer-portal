# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Storage Valet Portal Cannot Run Locally

## The Problem
Your Mac is **completely blocking** all local server connections. This is NOT a code issue.

## Immediate Workarounds

### Option 1: Deploy to Production (RECOMMENDED)
Since local development is blocked, deploy directly to Vercel:

```bash
# Make sure server is stopped first
pkill -f tsx

# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel Dev (Cloud Development)
```bash
# This runs your dev server in the cloud
vercel dev
```

### Option 3: Check System Security
1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
2. Look for any apps being blocked
3. Check "Developer Tools" section
4. Make sure Terminal has full permissions

### Option 4: Reset Network Settings
```bash
# Reset network preferences (requires restart)
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

### Option 5: Use Docker (If Installed)
```bash
# Create a Dockerfile and run in container
# This bypasses local security restrictions
```

## Why This Is Happening
- macOS security is blocking Node.js from accepting connections
- This often happens with M4 Macs and latest macOS
- Corporate security software can cause this
- VS Code's security model may have triggered stricter policies

## To Continue Development NOW
Since we can't test locally, I recommend:
1. Deploy to Vercel immediately
2. Use the production URL for testing
3. Make changes and redeploy as needed

The code is correct - your system is blocking it.
