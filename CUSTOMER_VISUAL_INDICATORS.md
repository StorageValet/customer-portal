## ❌ What We DON'T Show Customers

### Never Display:
- Cubic feet numbers (100, 200, 300)
- Technical measurements
- Length × Width × Height
- Weight in pounds (unless they ask)
- Complex calculations

### Internal Only:
- Cubic feet is for operations/routing

## 💬 Customer Communications

### Email/Notification Examples

#### Space Warning (85%)
```
Subject: Your Storage Space Update

Hi Sarah,

Just a heads up - your storage space is getting full (85% used).

You still have room for a few more items, but if you're planning 
to store more, you might want to consider our Medium plan.

[View My Storage] [Upgrade Options]
```

#### Insurance Alert (Over Limit)
```
Subject: Protect Your Valuables

Hi John,

Your stored items are now valued above your plan's included 
protection. For just $24/month, you can ensure everything 
is fully covered.

## 🚫 Avoid These Phrases

### Don't Say:
- "You've used 85 cubic feet"
- "100 cu.ft capacity"
- "Your items weigh 187 pounds"
- "Dimensions total 15.5 cubic feet"

### Do Say:
- "Your space is 85% full"
- "You have room for more"
- "Consider upgrading for more space"
- "Your items are protected"

## 🎯 The Goal

Customers should:
1. **Quickly understand** their usage at a glance
2. **Never feel confused** by technical terms
3. **Naturally discover** upgrade options when needed
4. **Feel confident** their items are protected

We track cubic feet internally for operations, but customers just see clean percentages and friendly messages.
