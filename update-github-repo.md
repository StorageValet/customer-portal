# Updating Your GitHub Repository

Since your GitHub repo is outdated (Replit-based), let's update it with your current code.

## Steps to Update:

### 1. First, authenticate with GitHub (choose one):

**Option A: GitHub CLI (Easiest)**
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
# Follow browser prompts
```

**Option B: Personal Access Token**
- Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Create token with 'repo' scope
- Save the token

### 2. Force push your current code:

```bash
# This will REPLACE everything on GitHub with your local version
git push --force origin main
```

When prompted:
- Username: StorageValet (or your username)
- Password: [your token from step 1]

### 3. Update Repository Settings on GitHub:

After pushing, go to https://github.com/StorageValet/customer-portal/settings and update:

1. **Description**: 
   "Storage Valet Customer Portal - React/Express/Airtable application"

2. **Website**: 
   Remove any Replit URL

3. **Topics** (add these):
   - react
   - typescript
   - express
   - airtable
   - stripe

### 4. Update the About section:
- Remove any mention of Replit
- Add "Development via GitHub Codespaces"

## What This Accomplishes:

✅ Replaces old Replit code with current version
✅ Preserves repository URL and settings
✅ Shows clear transition to modern architecture
✅ Ready for Codespaces development

## Warning:
`--force` push will overwrite ALL code on GitHub with your local version. This is what we want since the GitHub version is outdated.
