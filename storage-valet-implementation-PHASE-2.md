# Storage Valet Customer Portal - Implementation Guide

**Date**: July 29, 2025  
**Priority**: Launch-ready by end of July 30, 2025  
**Agent**: This document provides your implementation priorities and architectural decisions.

## üö® CRITICAL CONTEXT

- **Current State**: Portal is ~85% complete with working auth, Airtable integration, and basic features
- **Launch Goal**: Fully functional customer portal within 24-36 hours
- **Business Model**: Premium storage concierge service with AI-driven operations
- **Key Stakeholder**: Zach (founder) needs this live to onboard waiting customers

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES (In Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Breaking Issues (If Any Remain)

- [ ] Verify all authentication methods work (email/password, Google OAuth)
- [ ] Ensure navigation works on mobile (iOS Safari priority)
- [ ] Test that Sessions table is properly storing/retrieving data
- [ ] Confirm items can be created, updated, and deleted without errors

### Priority 2: Implement Batch Delivery Scheduling ‚≠ê

**This is THE key differentiator for Storage Valet**

```typescript
// Required functionality:
// 1. Customer selects multiple items from inventory
// 2. Clicks "Schedule Delivery"
// 3. Chooses single date/time
// 4. System creates ONE movement with multiple containers
// 5. Sends single confirmation email

// Update Movement creation to handle:
interface CreateMovementRequest {
  type: "pickup" | "delivery";
  itemIds: string[]; // Array of container IDs
  scheduledDate: Date;
  scheduledTimeSlot: string;
  specialInstructions?: string;
  // For batch deliveries, this should support multiple items
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Add multi-select checkboxes to inventory page
2. Add "Schedule Delivery" button that appears when items selected
3. Create modal for date/time selection
4. Modify backend to accept array of itemIds
5. Update email template to list all items in single confirmation

### Priority 3: Complete API Integrations

#### 3.1 Dropbox Photo Storage

```typescript
// In server/routes.ts - update photo upload endpoint
// Use environment variable: DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
// Fallback: If no token, use placeholder images (already implemented)
```

#### 3.2 Email Notifications via Zapier

```typescript
// Required notifications:
// - Welcome email (on signup)
// - Pickup confirmation
// - Delivery confirmation
// - 24-hour reminder

// Use ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL from environment
// Send structured data:
{
  type: 'pickup_confirmation',
  customer: { name, email },
  movement: { date, timeSlot, items },
  confirmationNumber: string
}
```

#### 3.3 Stripe Subscription Flow Fix

**Critical Business Logic**:

```typescript
// Current flow needs adjustment:
// 1. Signup ‚Üí Collect setup fee (50% of monthly rate)
// 2. Customer completes onboarding
// 3. First pickup CONFIRMED ‚Üí Start monthly subscription
// 4. Bill monthly on pickup anniversary

// Setup fees:
// Starter: $199/month ‚Üí $100 setup
// Standard: $299/month ‚Üí $150 setup
// Family: $399/month ‚Üí $200 setup
```

### Priority 4: AI Concierge Implementation ü§ñ

**Basic Version for Launch**:

```typescript
// Floating chat button (bottom-right corner)
// Uses OPENAI_API_KEY

const systemPrompt = `You are the Storage Valet AI Concierge. You help customers:
- Navigate the portal
- Understand our services
- Schedule pickups/deliveries
- Manage their inventory
- Answer questions about pricing and insurance

Current customer context:
- Name: {customerName}
- Plan: {plan}
- Items in storage: {itemCount}
- Current page: {currentPage}

Maintain a professional, helpful, concierge-level tone.`;

// Log all conversations for future training
interface ConversationLog {
  customerId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  messages: Array<{ role: "user" | "assistant"; content: string }>;
  page: string;
  resolved: boolean;
}
```

### Priority 5: Data Collection Architecture üìä

**Every significant action should log to Airtable**:

```typescript
// Create new Airtable table: "Analytics_Events"
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  customerId: string;
  eventType: string; // 'signup', 'item_added', 'pickup_scheduled', etc.
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: {
    promoCode?: string;
    source?: string;
    itemCount?: number;
    value?: number;
    [key: string]: any;
  };
}
```

### Priority 6: Customer Onboarding Flow Polish

1. **Registration Path**:
   - Add promo code field to signup
   - Ensure proper plan selection UI
   - Validate address during signup

2. **Setup Payment Page**:
   - Clear messaging about setup fee vs monthly
   - Show exactly what customer is paying today
   - Explain when monthly billing starts

3. **Welcome Tutorial Enhancement**:
   - Interactive walkthrough of adding first item
   - Explain QR code system
   - Show how to schedule pickup

### Priority 7: Test Data & QA Setup

Create test accounts with realistic scenarios:

```typescript
const testCustomers = [
  {
    email: "new.customer@test.com",
    plan: "starter",
    items: [], // Empty inventory
    scenario: "Brand new user",
  },
  {
    email: "active.family@test.com",
    plan: "family",
    items: 50, // Mix of seasonal items
    scenario: "Large family with seasonal rotation",
  },
  {
    email: "premium.user@test.com",
    plan: "standard",
    items: 20, // High-value items
    scenario: "Insurance limit testing",
  },
];
```

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION WITH ZACH

- Ask for clarification if anything is unclear
- Share progress updates regularly
- Flag any blockers immediately
- Suggest better solutions if you see them

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know you've succeeded when:

- Zach can onboard his waitlist customers
- Users complete signup ‚Üí first pickup without support
- The experience feels premium and "just works"
- Data is being captured for future growth

---

**Remember**: Quality over features. Better to have fewer features that work perfectly than many features with bugs. Zach needs this to work flawlessly for his early customers to build word-of-mouth growth.

Good luck! You're building the foundation of a technology-first storage company that will scale to 100+ customers while maintaining premium service quality.
