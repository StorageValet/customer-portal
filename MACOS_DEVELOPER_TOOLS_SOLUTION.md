# ✅ SOLUTION: macOS Developer Tools Permission

## The Problem
macOS was blocking localhost connections due to security restrictions, preventing:
- Local development servers from being accessible
- Inter-process communication between Node.js and browsers
- Terminal and Claude Code from running "unsigned" development code

## The Solution
Add Terminal and Claude to the Developer Tools allowed list in System Settings.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Open System Settings**
   - Apple Menu → System Settings

2. **Navigate to Privacy & Security**
   - Privacy & Security → Developer Tools

3. **Add Applications**
   - Click the `+` button
   - Add:
     - Terminal
     - Claude
     - Any other development tools (VS Code, etc.)

4. **Toggle On**
   - Ensure the toggle is ON for each application

5. **Restart Applications**
   - Quit and restart Terminal
   - Quit and restart Claude Code

## What This Does
This setting allows applications to:
- Run software locally that doesn't meet system security policy
- Bind to localhost ports
- Create inter-process connections
- Execute unsigned code (like development servers)

## Verification
After enabling, test with:
```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

## Additional Applications to Consider Adding
- Visual Studio Code
- iTerm2
- GitHub Desktop
- Any IDE or development tool

## Why This Wasn't Obvious
- This setting is relatively new in macOS
- It's buried in Privacy & Security settings
- The error messages don't point to this solution
- It affects "modern" macOS security policies

## Impact
With this enabled:
- ✅ Local development works normally
- ✅ No need for Codespaces (unless you want it)
- ✅ Can develop offline
- ✅ Full localhost access restored
- ✅ All ports accessible as expected

This discovery solves the core issue that was preventing local development!
