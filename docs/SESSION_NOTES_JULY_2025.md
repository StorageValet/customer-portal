# Storage Valet Portal - Session Notes (July 2025)

## Critical Fix: Consolidated Back to Single Server Architecture

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: UI stuck on "Loading..." - frontend couldn't reach backend API
- **Root Cause**: Split server architecture (frontend on 3000, backend on 3001)
- **User Feedback**: "why do we need this app to be on two separate servers? It was only on a single server when the app was working reliably days ago"
- **Solution**: Consolidated back to single server on port 3000

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Proxy Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // REMOVED the proxy that was causing split server issues:
   proxy: {
     "/api": {
       target: "http://localhost:3001",
       changeOrigin: true,
     },
   }
   ```

2. **Updated Environment** (`.env`):
   - Changed `PORT=3001` back to `PORT=3000`

3. **Enhanced Authentication** (`server/routes/auth-routes.ts`):
   - Added better error logging for debugging
   - Improved password validation messages

4. **Created Reliable Session Store** (`server/simple-session-store.ts`):
   - Implements fallback pattern to prevent Airtable failures from blocking auth
   - Automatically switches to memory store when Airtable fails

### Current Status
âœ… **Application is working properly on single server**
- Frontend loads correctly
- API responds on same port
- Authentication works (tested with zach@mystoragevalet.com)
- No more "Loading..." issue

### To Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access at: http://localhost:3000

### Session Summary
1. Started with user request to fix authentication issues
2. Discovered split server architecture was causing frontend/backend communication failure
3. User explicitly requested return to single server setup
4. Successfully consolidated to port 3000
5. Verified application loads and authentication works

### Known Working State
- Single server on port 3000
- Both API and frontend served from same Express server
- Authentication functional with existing accounts
- No proxy configuration needed in development
