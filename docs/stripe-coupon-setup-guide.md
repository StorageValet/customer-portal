## Coupon Metadata

Use metadata to track campaigns and special rules:

- `waives_setup_fee`: Set to "true" for 100% setup fee waivers
- `campaign`: Track marketing campaigns (e.g., "summer2025", "partner_xyz")
- `partner_id`: Track partner/referral sources
- `max_uses`: Internal tracking (Stripe has its own usage limits)

## How the Integration Works

### 1. Signup Flow

- User enters coupon code during signup
- Real-time validation shows discount message
- Coupon is stored with user record

### 2. Payment Flow

- Setup payment page automatically applies the coupon
- If 100% off, no payment required
- Partial discounts show adjusted amount

### 3. Data Storage

- Stripe Customer ID stored in Airtable
- Applied coupon code stored in referralCode field
- Stripe tracks all usage and analytics

## Testing Coupons

### In Test Mode

1. Create test coupons with "TEST\_" prefix
2. Use Stripe test card numbers
3. Verify discount application

### Test Scenarios
