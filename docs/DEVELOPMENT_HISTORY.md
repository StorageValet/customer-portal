# Storage Valet Portal - Development History

## Project Timeline
- **March 18, 2025**: Storage Valet business officially registered
- **June 2025**: Initial portal architecture and setup
- **July 2025**: Major development work begins
- **Late July 2025**: Intensive portal development (10-14 days before August 6)
- **August 5-6, 2025**: Localhost troubleshooting and deployment attempts

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: June 2025 - Architecture & Schema
**Focus**: Codebase health and Airtable schema
- Implemented comprehensive schema synchronization system
- Created TypeScript definitions for all 11 Airtable tables
- Built schema validation tools
- Improved codebase rating from 7/10 to 8/10
- **Key Files Created**: 
  - `shared/airtable-schema.ts`
  - `server/enhanced-storage.ts`
  - `tools/schema-validator.ts`

### Session 2: July 2025 - Consolidation & Features
**Focus**: Server architecture and file uploads
- Consolidated from split-server back to single-server architecture
- Implemented Dropbox photo upload system
- Removed Replit dependencies
- Fixed authentication flow
- **Key Achievement**: Resolved "Loading..." issue that was blocking development

### Session 3: August 6, 2025 - Localhost Issues & Deployment
**Focus**: Attempting to resolve Mac localhost blocking
- **Duration**: ~5-6 hours
- **Issue**: macOS security blocking all localhost connections
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Server configuration changes (ports, binding addresses)
  - Vercel deployment (failed due to architecture mismatch)
  - System diagnostics and security checks
- **Root Cause**: Corporate/security software blocking inter-process communication
- **Resolution**: Recommended GitHub Codespaces for development

## Current Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Session-based auth
- **Database**: Airtable (11 tables planned, 3 implemented)
- **Storage**: Dropbox for photos
- **Email**: SendGrid (primary), Gmail (backup)
- **Payments**: Stripe (LIVE mode)
- **AI**: OpenAI integration (currently disabled)

### Deployment Status
- **Local Development**: Blocked by macOS security
- **Vercel**: Incompatible (requires serverless functions)
- **Recommended**: Railway or Render (traditional Node.js hosting)
- **Alternative**: GitHub Codespaces for development

## Key Decisions & Learnings

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Single Server**: Consolidated from split architecture for simplicity
2. **Session-based Auth**: Using Airtable as session store
3. **No Softr Integration Needed**: Direct Airtable access is sufficient
4. **Fixed Pricing Model**: $199/$299/$349 monthly plans

### Technical Learnings
1. **Platform Compatibility**: Express apps need traditional hosting, not serverless
2. **Security Restrictions**: Modern macOS can block development servers
3. **Cloud Development**: Viable alternative to local development
4. **Documentation**: Critical for project continuity

## Outstanding Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Deploy to production (Railway/Render)
- [ ] Implement remaining 8 Airtable tables
- [ ] Add centralized error handling
- [ ] Set up Jest testing framework

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Integrate enhanced storage layer into routes
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper logging with Winston

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Re-enable AI chatbot
- [ ] Add comprehensive analytics
- [ ] Implement advanced route optimization
- [ ] Create admin dashboard
