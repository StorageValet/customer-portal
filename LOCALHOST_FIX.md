# Storage Valet Portal - Localhost Access Fix

## The Problem
Your Mac is blocking external programs (browsers, curl) from connecting to Node.js servers, even though the servers are running correctly.

## Confirmed Working
- ✅ Node.js servers start and bind to ports
- ✅ Node.js can connect to itself
- ❌ External programs cannot connect to Node.js

## This is likely due to:
1. **macOS Security Framework** blocking inter-process communication
2. **RemoteManagement.framework** (MDM) restrictions detected on your system
3. **System Integrity Protection (SIP)** enhancements in recent macOS

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### 1. Open a NEW Terminal Window
Not a tab - a completely new Terminal window:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health
```

### 2. Use Safari (Not Chrome/Arc)
Safari has special OS privileges:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

### 3. Grant Terminal Full Disk Access
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → Add Terminal

### 4. Use sudo (Temporary Test)
```bash
sudo npm run dev
```
Then try accessing http://localhost:3000

### 5. Nuclear Option - Disable SIP (NOT RECOMMENDED)
1. Restart Mac in Recovery Mode (Cmd+R)
2. Open Terminal
3. Run: `csrutil disable`
4. Restart

## Alternative Development Options

### GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Open in Codespaces
3. Free 60 hours/month
4. No local restrictions

### Docker Desktop
1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Run in container (bypasses some restrictions)

### Remote Development
1. Use a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode)
2. Deploy there for development
3. Access via public URL

## For Deployment (When Ready)
Use Railway or Render - NOT Vercel (architecture mismatch)
