# Email Integration Guide for Storage Valet

## Overview
The Storage Valet application uses a cost-effective email integration approach that leverages your existing Google Workspace account and Zapier automation.

## How It Works

### 1. Webhook Integration
- When customers schedule pickup/delivery appointments, the application sends structured data to a Zapier webhook
- This webhook triggers a Zap that formats and sends emails using your Google Workspace Gmail account
- No additional email service costs - uses your existing Google Workspace subscription

### 2. Email Templates
The system sends two types of confirmation emails:

#### Pickup Confirmation Template
Subject: `Storage Valet Pickup Confirmation - [CONFIRMATION_NUMBER]`

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Zapier Webhook
1. Log in to your Zapier account
2. Create a new Zap with "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger
3. Choose "Catch Hook" and copy the webhook URL
4. Set the webhook URL as `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable

### 2. Configure Gmail Action
1. Add "Gmail" as the action app in your Zap
2. Choose "Send Email" as the action
3. Map the webhook fields to email template fields:

  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "customerEmail": "john@example.com",
  "scheduledDate": "2025-01-15",

  "template": "pickup_confirmation",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-11T21:30:00.000Z"
