# Storage Valet Web Application

## Overview

Storage Valet is a premium technology-enabled storage concierge service that provides door-to-door pickup and delivery of customers' belongings. This repository contains a full-stack web application built with React frontend and Express backend, designed primarily as a customer portal for managing stored items and scheduling pickups/deliveries.

**Project Focus**: Customer portal functionality rather than landing/marketing pages. The landing page will be built separately using Softr. Customers receive portal access links after registering through the external Softr-built landing page.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Domain & Deployment Notes

Primary domain: @mystoragevalet.com (currently connected to Softr app)
- User owns multiple domains available for deployment
- Future integration required: Connect this application to @mystoragevalet.com domain
- Current Softr app may need to be replaced or integrated with this system

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Session Management**: MemoryStore session management for SSO/traditional auth hybrid
- **Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing with multi-provider support
- **Database**: Airtable production database with AirtableStorage implementation

### Database Strategy
- **Current**: AirtableStorage class providing production-ready data persistence
- **Architecture**: Airtable-based backend with native API integration
- **Migration Status**: Successfully migrated from PostgreSQL/Drizzle to Airtable for full production deployment
- **Session Store**: Custom AirtableSessionStore for persistent session management
- **Field Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping between app fields and Airtable schema
- **Table Structure**: 
  - Customers (Users) - Customer profiles and authentication
  - Containers (Items) - Inventory items with photos and metadata
  - Movements - Pickup/delivery scheduling
  - Sessions - Persistent session storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Email/password, Google OAuth, planned Apple Sign-In
- **Hybrid Authentication**: Seamless support for both SSO and traditional sessions
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Session Management**: AirtableSessionStore with 7-day TTL
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware checking both OAuth and session authentication
- **User Context**: React Context API for frontend state management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for authentication failures

### Customer Portal Features
- **Dashboard**: Overview of storage stats, recent items, and quick actions
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations for stored items with photo support

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Frontend makes API requests using fetch with credentials
2. TanStack Query handles caching and state synchronization
3. Express routes handle authentication and business logic
4. Storage layer abstracts database operations

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates and creates session
3. Session ID stored in HTTP-only cookie
4. Protected routes check session validity
5. Client maintains auth state via React Context

### Item Management Flow
1. User uploads item photos (planned Dropbox integration)
2. Items stored with metadata and categorization
3. Status tracking (at_home, in_storage)
4. Movement requests link items to pickup/delivery schedules

## External Dependencies

### Planned Integrations
- **Dropbox API**: Photo storage and management
- **Airtable API**: External database integration option
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for production

### Current Dependencies
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons

- **Authentication**: bcrypt, express-session

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Replit-optimized with custom plugins
- Hot module replacement via Vite
- Environment variables for configuration
- Development banner for Replit integration

### Production Considerations
- Build process: Vite for frontend, ESBuild for backend
- Static file serving through Express
- Session security configuration
- Database migration from in-memory to PostgreSQL

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration
- Separate development and production settings
- Database URL configuration for PostgreSQL
- Session secret management

## Recent Changes (January 27, 2025)

### Authentication Error Handling Fix (Complete - January 27, 2025)
**Fixed critical app crash on OAuth authentication:**
- **Issue**: App was crashing with unhandled promise rejection when OAuth login attempted without proper Airtable configuration
- **Root Cause**: Airtable API authentication error was not being caught in the upsertUser function
- **Solution**: Added try-catch error handling in replitAuth.ts to gracefully handle Airtable errors
- **Type Fix**: Fixed TypeScript error in routes.ts by ensuring qrCode field is never undefined when creating items
- **Result**: App now runs stably even if Airtable authentication temporarily fails, preventing crashes during OAuth flow
